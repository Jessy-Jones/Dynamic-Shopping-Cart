# Shopping Cart Simulation

This Python program simulates a basic shopping cart with the following features:

- **Add items:** Users can add items to the cart with their names, prices, and optional discounts.
- **Item details:** Users can provide additional details about each item (e.g., color, size).
- **Discount handling:** The program can apply multiple percentage discounts to each item.
- **Duplicate item check:** Prevents adding duplicate items to the cart.
- **Cart summary:** Displays a summary of the cart, including all items, their final prices, and the total cost.

**How to run:**

1. Save the code as a Python file (e.g., `shopping_cart.py`).
2. Run the script from your terminal using `python shopping_cart.py`.

**Example Usage:**

The program will guide you through adding items to the cart. Follow the prompts to enter item names, prices, discounts, and details.

**To-do:**

- Implement more discount types (e.g., fixed amount discounts).
- Allow users to remove items from the cart.
- Add support for taxes.
- Save and load cart data from a file.
- Create a more user-friendly interface (e.g., using a library like `tkinter`).
